This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

## Demo

You can check the website out at [Speedy Assignment](https://659e97bb89a086ed72d9b47e--ubiquitous-otter-938a90.netlify.app/)

## Steps

You will land on the authentication page. You can either sign-in or sign-up.

Since it's a mock authentication, the credentials for login have been set as follows:

Log-in page credentials:

- Username: demo
- Password: demo123

Notes:

- For sign-up page, any credentials will work.
- Once logged in you will be redirected to image upload page.
- Username is validated for special characters. You can use alphanumeric characters.

## What is different this time?

- Fresh design (inspired by Speedy!!)

- Extra Features:
  - Want to have both blur and sepia? No worries, it is handled.
  - Need only 5px blur effect as opposed to the default value set previously? That's handled as well!
  - Change image directly from the toolbar!
